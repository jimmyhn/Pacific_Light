Notes from Botvinick
Paper has trap stiffness (spring constant)
.7 nm/V; conversion factor found in the data (solve for x)
Normalization factor for the histogram is number of data points * bin width

How to get from distance -> force; voltage -> velocity
voltage -> distance is experimentally derived 
Trap of the laser force is the spring constant*x  (F=kx)
    x is defined as the distance between the center of the trap and the center of the bead
If a bond forms between the bead and the cell, the shift can be calculated through the detector

4 voltages are measured from the QBP (which is what is in the file)
    x = (V2+V4) - (V1+V3)
    ECG-like graph is measuring Vx, but needs to be converted into nm
    Graph looks the same, but y-axis is nm
    curve fit for the graph
Turn nm into force
    multiply nm by k (stiffness) to get graph into F (pN)

3 columns of data: x, y, and sum
    botvinick doesn't remember which one is which
    We want the column with the higher magnitudes
No Fourier transform in this project

Force waveform is periodic, so cycles can be defined
    Each cycle has a peak value, which is the rupture force
He wants the histogram of what all the rupture values are
Normalize the histogram to get the density (unsure about this part)

Botvinick will try to find more data for us :D
